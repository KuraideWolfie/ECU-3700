## Course Information
<b>Semester Taken:</b> Fall 2018 <br/>
<b>Code, Name:</b> CSCI 3700, Database Management Systems <br/>
<b>Instructor:</b> Venkat Gudivada <br/>
<b>Language(s):</b> Java <br />

Description: <br/>
Database Management Systems was a class regarding the design and implementation of database systems. Information about conceptual, logical, and physical schema was overviewed alongside two and three-tier architecture, as well as SQL and relational algebra operations â€“ SELECT, PROJECT, RENAME, UNION, JOIN, INTERSECT, etc. <br/>

## Project Description
The project for database management systems is a semester-long project that encompasses building a data-intensive web application, where the application must handle a lot of data (data in the millions of values/points). After generating the database, and providing a conceptual, logical, and physical schema, an application, either via Java console or otherwise, was to be developed to provide interaction with the database. <i>(The project was supposed to use PostgreSQL and PgAdmin 4 software for database creation and management.)</i>

###Important Files
- <b>query-create.sql:</b> An SQL file that, when used with PostgreSQL, will generate all tables for usage in the project.
- <b>schema:</b> A directory containing the conceptual, logical, and physical schema alongside a use-case diagram of the system.
- <b>generator:</b> A directory containing a data generator Java project.
- <b>app:</b> A directory containing the project that interfaces with the database
